    <h1>about ✏️</h1>
    <p>
        A multimedia webnovel about a group of kiddos conquering Ithaca, a mysterious land tucked away
        in a corner of the earth where dreams and reality are indistinguishable.
    </p>
    <p>
        I don't have much experience with writing longer pieces, so we'll see how this one goes.
        No matter what happens, though, I'll try to make it an entertaining ride! So thanks for joining! :D

                A shy bookworm who wants nothing to do with Morpheus Academy nor developing her DREAM ability.
                &bull; Loves frogs. Luckily for her, one of the
                side effects of her dream ability is a small green frog named Bashō.
                &bull; Affectionately nicknamed "Grannie Kafka" because of her white hair, cynical attitude on life,
                and worryingly creaky knees. Too bad being a Morpheus Academy student means plenty of running around.

                Power: HAIKU. Materialize scenes and figures from memorized verses. Nobody has an idea what
                this entails, especially Kafka. Potentially REALITY-WARPING dream ability, or simply a trivial trick?

                An ambitious mad scientist always tinkering with whatever she can get her hands on, from
                reacting chemicals with the curious glassy material of OVERWORLD's leaves to making
                robots out of mechanical pencils.
                &bull; After too many tired jokes about her name, her catchphrase is not "it's a cinch."

                the insight of human mechanics and repair robots by communicating with them.

                The youngest member of Morpheus Academy's Council of Dreamers. A hero in the truest sense of
                the word, she is always ready to lend a hand, or, as Kafka puts it, "likes being annoying."
                &bull; As a side effect of her ability, small glowing stars crop up in her hair, although
                they are easily confused as somewhat strange hairclips.

            <p class="power">
                Power: PROTAGONIST. No matter what happens, it seems that the dream-wielder always emerges
                victorious. Also lulls vulnerable individuals into forgetting about themselves and their own dreams. 
                &bull; Referred to as the "center of the universe" ability because of the added
                ability to create and manipulate celestial matter.
                &bull; Well on its way to becoming a REALITY-WARPING dream ability.
