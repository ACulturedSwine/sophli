        I'm calling these part of the dream on! OST because that sounds cooler, but this is just a hodgepodge
        of character-themed music and Ithaca BGM. We'll see how the music plays out in the later installments
        of the webnovel.

        Currently working on two songs, "kafka" and "for you." I'm planning on changing up the instrumentation and mixing/mastering 
        in FL Studio to enhance the warm acousticness of "kafka" and the <s>despacito vibes</s>
        moody/energetic tone of "for you."

        Previews of the songs below.
