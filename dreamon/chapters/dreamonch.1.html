The teacher, a slender man with a shock of lilac-colored hair and half-moon glasses, taps on his desk to wait for the boisterous kids to settle down.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Alright, guys, today we&rsquo;re doing something fun!&rdquo; He excitedly gestures towards the board, and the entire class groans.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, at least you all can read it.&rdquo; Shaking his head, the man picks up a wooden pointer and taps on the board.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;So, what do you want to be when you grow up? Well, that&rsquo;s a hard question, huh? I&rsquo;ll be honest with you, you haven&rsquo;t experienced a whole lot of life, making it tough to answer. So, I&rsquo;ll give a few tips that helped me when I was your age.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;First,&rdquo; he points to a picture of a heart, &ldquo;Write what you know. What do you like?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>He begins pacing around the classroom, first stopping at the play area to pick up a rubber ball and a book -- &ldquo;Hobbies?&rdquo; -- before throwing it away, causing children to shout as they duck for cover -- &ldquo;Favorite animals? Sports? Movies? Stories? Colors? Flowers, er&hellip; I&rsquo;m really running out of ideas here&hellip;&rdquo;-- and grabs a child&rsquo;s lunch box and opens it, showing a plastic box holding some orange chicken and sushi (eliciting a </span><span class="c4">Hey!</span><span class="c2">) &ldquo;...Food? Well, go the &lsquo;favorite route&rsquo; if you&rsquo;re running out of ideas.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The students nodded in thought and murmured noises of agreement (except for the one person whose lunch box&rsquo;s contents was unexpectedly revealed).</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Or&hellip;.&rdquo; He runs back to the blackboard, having completed an entire circuit around the classroom, and points to the second chalk illustration of a star, &ldquo;Write what you don&rsquo;t know, but want to try.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Is there someone you look up to? What are they like? What about them do you want to emulate?&rdquo; The projector suddenly flickers on without any warning, and he rapidly clicks through a series of images of famous people -- explorers who conquered lands from the Seven Seas to the southern tip of Africa, bushy-faced scientists with impossibly wrinkled expressions and equally groundbreaking theories, actors starring in old-timey films and the newest flicks alike, political leaders with their stuffy-looking suits and ties speaking out all proud from podiums, all kinds of professions and monumental achievements! &ldquo;Well, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be well-known people, either. I just picked these pictures off of Google. I don&rsquo;t have a picture of your grandmother or something. That would be weird.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Or is there something that you want to change about yourself? How do you want to do that?&rdquo; He flips to the next slide, showing a picture of a chart filled with kittens, under each of them either a core value or personality trait. &ldquo;Think about what it&rsquo;s like to be that kind of person. You know, really soak it in! Method acting! Fake it &lsquo;til ya make it! Concentrate on that trait so hard that you can&rsquo;t think of anything else anymore and soon you&rsquo;ll find yourself to be a changed person.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Third of all, and the most important,&rdquo; his face grows mock-serious and he pauses for dramatic effect, &ldquo;Ignore everything I just said!&rdquo; In a wild, uncontained manner, he scratches across the chalkboard and crosses out all of the work he did in the past few minutes like it&rsquo;s nothing, and at the same time, the projector overhead grows out of control, flickering through the previously seen slides but altered this time, from curling mustaches drawn on prominent actresses to random expressions drawn on the kittens that conflicted with the words written underneath them.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The teacher says in a singsong voice and raises his arms like a conductor at the grandest orchestral performance they have ever had in their lives,&ldquo;Dreams don&rsquo;t have any rhyme or reason; they </span><span class="c4">don&rsquo;t need to</span><span class="c2">! Write it, draw it, fold it into the shape that you want to become! Well, the last bit I mean metaphorically, but hey, if you can somehow alter the handout into your answer, I&rsquo;ll take that as a completed assignment, I don&rsquo;t care!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No, seriously, I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; &nbsp;Everyone just became more confused while he became even cheerier (was that even possible?) and clapped his hands together. &ldquo;Anyhoo, get back to work! Time&rsquo;s a ticking, only half an hour for you to write something! The nation&rsquo;s counting on ya bright young fellows.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He could see their faces scrunched up in thought as they were confronted with this hard question. This question was a troubling one, because it made them realize how much time had passed already. It seemed like yesterday that they were in awe of how large the school was, and how small it seems now! What was once a sprawling terrain waiting to be mapped out was now a clear map in their heads. Every nook and cranny, from favorite playtime spots to hiding areas was discovered, and there was nothing left for them but to dream, to dream of something bigger than this school that would so quickly turn into yet another childhood memory. They didn&rsquo;t know what to dream, but they did know how, doodling pictures of princesses and superheroes in tiny notepads and playing pretend in recess. Little by little, people finally think of something that they&rsquo;d like and write it down frantically, hoping that their dreams would be good enough.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Soon enough, the school bell rang, and the teacher received a messy stack of papers. Some were haphazardly conceived (evident in the one handout with </span><span class="c4">my favorite food</span><span>, written under some surprisingly detailed drawings of candy), and some were a little out of touch with reality but incredibly imaginative, like the one with the word </span><span class="c4">pilot </span><span class="c2">at the top and a picture of a person flying in the sky without any aerial vehicle in sight -- piloting themselves, he supposed. He hummed in contentment, hoping that what he said would help them discover a little bit more of who they are and who they wanted to be. Hey, maybe his words would even create the next hero of the century, someone who would irrevocably change the world. Life is funny like that.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Well, anyways, it would be time soon enough for them to start dreaming.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">---</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">What I am doing what am I doing what am I doing </span><span class="c2">was all Kafka could think as the clock ticked down. Mr. Novikov&rsquo;s assignment was very funny. Write down what you want to be when you grow up? Just like that? And what was he going on about folding the paper? She didn&rsquo;t have a clue of what to write about, heck, she didn&rsquo;t even know what she would want to eat for dinner today. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Maybe I could still salvage this</span><span class="c2">, she thought in a panic as the clock ticked down. Ever since they were little, they were taught that dreams could be anything that you wanted, as long as you felt strongly enough about it. Well, there was something that caught her attention a week ago, and maybe it wouldn&rsquo;t be a short-lived passion after all. Maybe, just maybe. She pulled out a thin little book and started copying down its contents in a feverish manner. Then the bell rang, and the moment was gone in a flick, vanishing like a splash of watercolor in the sea.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Sitting at the very top of the stack of papers, the last one to be turned in a rush was Kafka&rsquo;s dream scrawled with youthful anxiety.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">I don&rsquo;t know how I should write my answer, so I want to learn how to express my thoughts better. Like this?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Wake butterfly &ndash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">it&rsquo;s late, we&rsquo;ve miles</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">to go together.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">---</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Then, just like that, school was over. Summer was filled with vapid pursuits of nothing, reading fantasy novels and playing indie platformers. It went in the best kind of way - in a blur, a half-forgotten memory and thoughts of happiness still lingering. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">One night, Kafka drifted asleep and dreamt of a white space. Even though there wasn&rsquo;t anything there, she was happy. The happiest that she has ever been. It was calming, to sit in that space without any distractions, but that made it so the tiniest thing would bother her. Then, she heard the sound of people talking. She didn&rsquo;t know what they were saying, but it made her feel bothered, feel frustrated that this little space of hers was deterred. Shut up! And then the voices went away.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A few peaceful moments later, a rich sound of the piano started pouring into her ears. Kafka liked the song and it reminded her of the sour-sweetness of citrus, but as the same melody started over again and continued, she quickly grew irritated. Shut up! And the unnamed song faded into the air.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">At last, peace in all of its blankness. It was so quiet that she could only hear the slow flutter of her breath warming her skin, the quiet beat of her heart that was the sole reminder of her existence. It was a bit lonely, sure, but she was happy because there wasn&rsquo;t anything in this room. Nothing to be cleaned up, become disorganized with the plight of entropy, and to be cleaned up again, no worries to think about. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">All of a sudden, she could hear what seemed like the sound of waterfalls, a thousand flutters, the flapping of wings. Shut up! Kafka cried, her appeal for silence ringing into the void of the white space. But no matter how she objected, this disturbance wouldn&rsquo;t cease.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Wake up!&rdquo; A scream into her ear.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Eh,&rdquo; Kafka, half-asleep, murmured. &ldquo;Lemme sleep a little longer&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">She blinked open her eyes and saw a line of equally-confused students. In the room they were studded with blinking lights and an unintelligible shorthand written across the walls.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;Welcome to the first day of school, everybody!&rdquo; An eccentrically-dressed lady with a wide sweep of hair and pilot goggles said. &ldquo;I know that you might be wondering, </span><span class="c4">what&rsquo;s going on</span><span>? </span><span class="c4">Where is this place</span><span>? </span><span class="c4">Have I been kidnapped</span><span>?? And, well, to those questions, I&hellip; </span><span class="c4">won&rsquo;t</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;tell you a thing!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Pressing a button on the remote she held in her hands, she looked towards the students and waved farewell, &ldquo;Have fun guys!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The mysterious place that they found themselves in wasn&rsquo;t a room. In fact, very much the opposite. They were in an airplane thousands of miles above who knows where, and Kafka could feel the floor rumbling underneath her, and is that a sliding trapdoor, oh no --</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The floor broke open, and swarms of children began descending down from the heavens screaming their heads off. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">On the first day of school, they were dropped off via airplane. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Kafka never felt so sick in her life and the air roared in her ears and she braced herself for impact. The ground below looked real solid, unnecessarily solid and probably very painful if someone were, oh, you know, hurtling towards the earth at a few hundreds of miles a second.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s all over now. I wish I could have done something more meaningful than binge watch a ten-season show, and spend some more time with my family and friends, and ate more angel food cake before my brother ate it all, but it&rsquo;s all gone now, not the cake, that too, but also more importantly my life -- </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Splash</span><span class="c2">.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Wait, what? Splash? <br><br>Kafka lay on the dripping ground in bewilderment. Moments ago, she thought that she was hurtling towards the cold unforgiving earth, and it is now, but for just a split second she felt like the ground&hellip; liquified? That didn&rsquo;t make any sense.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">She blinked, and then trees were all around her. Well, they looked like trees, she guessed, but they grew in the most convoluted of shapes. One of the trees was long and slender, leaned over like a mother consoling her child. Another grew into the sky, its branches stretched out and bent like a clenched hand shaking in fury. Also one shaped like a silly straw, but lingering more on that thought sort of ruins the ominous atmosphere of these outlandish woodlands.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Fallen classmates around Kafka groaned and murmured weakly, rubbing their heads and wondering at how their limbs, all of them, in fact, were still intact.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Well, this was awkward.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Suddenly, Kafka&rsquo;s social anxiety kicked in, and the horrid realization just dawned on her that she was stuck with a group of people who she didn&rsquo;t even recognize at all, or worse, saw before but wasn&rsquo;t terribly familiar with, just a few times passing them in the hallway or being paired up in a forgettable class project or two.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I mean, I knew that the first day of school would be unimaginable, but I can&rsquo;t believe that this would happen&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, yeah, that&rsquo;s what unimaginable means, stupid.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...You&rsquo;re right&hellip;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This was a fate worse than death, truly. Some people started talking to one another, oh god it looks like some of them know each other, and some started laughing about how stupid and crazy this all was, a weird nightmare that they can&rsquo;t quite shake out of.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hey, what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A straw-haired boy picked out a card from his shirt pocket and read &ldquo;Welcome to Ithaca&rdquo; before flipping to the back, &ldquo;Icebreaker time! Tell everyone your name and, ugh, answer an icebreaker question? Each person has a different one&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Some of the kids started to groan.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What is this, preschool?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;No teachers around, so we don&rsquo;t </span><span class="c4">have </span><span class="c2">to do it, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I agree! If they decided to try to kill us on the first day, we should get to do what we want!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yeah!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Uh, guys? Did any of you see what it says at the very bottom of the card?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Curious, Kafka turned hers around, and her face paled along with other people&rsquo;s faces as they read: </span><span class="c4">Or else you&rsquo;ll be in mortal danger. Tehe~</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Besides the unfortunate message lay a doodle of a fuzzy bear. Normally, Kafka would have taken her time to appreciate how amazingly adorable it was with its teensy charcoal eyes and small smile, but all she could think of at the moment was what she just read. First they were almost dead, and now they&rsquo;re just sealing the deal?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seemingly at cue, a low growl erupted from deep within the woods, a cry that sounded both prehistoric and futuristic, if that were even possible. Was there an animal that could be attributed to this noise? Despite the frustration, no one knew, the answer seeming to be just on the tip of their tongues, just beyond the horizon of their minds.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the sound of that&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Run!! And everyone start introducing yourselves!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The boy who screeched out </span><span class="c4">Run </span><span class="c2">was a short but agile kid -- he was one of the few people at the front of the panicked crowd of students. Curls of chestnut hair slightly tinged lavender bouncing about, he said breathlessly, &ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Fenn, and my favorite color is mint-green!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"><br>&ldquo;Maggie! Hot dogs aren&rsquo;t sandwiches! Anyone who says they are should be banned from sandwiches forever!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Name&rsquo;s Taro! The first five digits of pi are 3.1415! ...This isn&rsquo;t even an icebreaker??&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;My real name&rsquo;s super long, so I just go by Pez! Favorite snack is Pocky sticks!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">After a few dozen introductions, soon Kafka had the courage to pipe up and contribute an introduction of her own. After all, she just had to say what her favorite animal was. Thanks to her nervousness and sudden burst of adrenaline, she fumbled regardless.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Favorite Kafka&rsquo;s frogs&hellip;. Er, my name&rsquo;s frog and I like Kafkas&hellip; I mean, I&rsquo;m Kafka and my favorite animal is frogs!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Then there was an awkward silence. Kafka wondered if it would be more accurate to say her favorite animal is the frog, but that sounded strange too &nbsp;-- no, she should have said frogs were her favorite animals! She never could seem to get that sentence construction sounding right. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yeah, frogs are pretty cool.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Wait, is that everybody?&rdquo;<br></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I think so, I wasn&rsquo;t keeping count!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Great, we can just keep on running for our lives now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">With these words, the frantic air quickly dissipated, and some of the students started slowing down to a jog, allowing themselves to finally soak in the new environment. Occasionally, one could hear the piano-plinking of small creatures scurrying about, hooting, chirping, cooing among the underbrush and canopies. If you didn&rsquo;t listen close enough, however, they would simply vanish from consciousness and become white noise. The hidden ambience of the forest. The trees surrounding them seemed to look more amicable, as if the trees here had personalities of their own. Their once daunting branches appeared soft to the touch and gently dipped down like willow trees blowing in the summertime, a curtain of thin glass-shaped leaves brushing over the crown. Splitting the light into a rainbow of hues, the iridescent leaves jingled in the wind to the tune of fragments of popular melodies and nostalgic songs, culminating in an oddly beautiful symphony that was both familiar and unfamiliar. That seemed to be the entire atmosphere of this cryptic thicket -- every sensation triggered a mingled shock of novel terror and profound d&eacute;j&agrave; vu.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Have we lost the monster?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"><br>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re missing one more person!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Quickly, everyone turned to the one person they hadn&#39;t yet seen breathlessly shout their icebreaker answer, a short girl with walnut-colored pigtails and a quaint olive-green safari hat bobbing around nervously as she felt the penetrating weight of her peers staring at her.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Do I have to say it? The question is kind of stupid&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As if on cue, the hidden beast pursuing them suddenly burst out of the bone-limbed trees, sending the glass-tipped branches in a portentous flurry of noise, almost music. It appeared as a dark goat-like devil, its massive head crowned with pointed ivory horns that seemed as if it were covered in a pale veneer of gold, shining in the scarce slivers of sunlight that dared enter the dense dreamlike forest. Beneath the mass of fur were hints of large, black watery eyes with speckles of exotic malachite.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Aaah! Okay!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The nightmarish monster snapped its jaw, revealing a set of sharp incisors punctuated by large canines on either end. The poor girl almost had tears in her eyes.<br><br>&ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Cinch -- &rdquo; (the goat (?) demon lets out a primal roar, shaking the ground beneath) &ldquo;-- I mean, Civic Cinch! Because I&rsquo;m a very, er, courteous and soft spoken person!&rdquo; (she says, screaming her head off.)</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Great! We got through everyone!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Why is the monster still not stopping????&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;So is the rising of my heartbeat!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As Kafka watched from the back of the crowd, she had a completely unrelated thought that shouldn&rsquo;t have appeared in a life-or-death situation, but there it was.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If one were to watch the moving mass of students in say, an outdoors track field, she thought, they would be thoroughly impressed. Immaculate form -- arms pumping at an angle of 90 degrees, straight back, knees drived up high but not too high -- and what unadulterated passion and energy that enlivened their young frames! Besides the mingled screams and incessant cries for mothers far away from wherever this hellish place was, of course, besides that. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Horns of ivory tearing straight through the overhead branches and frightening the perched birds away from a peaceful sleep, the creature was slowly gaining upon the newly inaugurated class of students, and in a flash, it clamped onto daydreaming Kafka, who immediately became paralyzed by the lack of solid ground under her feet and the unwelcome re-introduction a few feet into the air.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Who else are we missing for introductions?!&rdquo; A spectacled boy wailed, his pace quickening.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">All of a sudden, a girl dressed in sapling-green swooped in along a moving stairway of azaleas. With a wave of her hand, ginkgos erupted from the ground, engulfing the monster in a girthy tangle of branches, and further twisting her fingers, she forced the magically grown trees to embrace the horned beast in a tighter lock.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Qiu here! My favorite animal&rsquo;s the civet. Frogs are a good choice too, though!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Afterwards, her white-haired companion whose face was covered by two or three layers of plaid scarves rapidly whispered a cryptic answer that sounded like &ldquo;Sven, water&rsquo;s wet -- I mean, it feels pretty wet to me,&rdquo; his eyes glowing hot before two soft round ears erupted from his head and the monster&rsquo;s head became encased in ice, releasing Kafka, still paralyzed, from her toothy prison.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Following after, a third person, their identity obscured by a tragedy theater mask, drew from a deck of cards a nine of spades. In an instant, their mask turned into the smiling face of comedy, and they yanked out of their pocket seemingly out of thin air a ticking bomb to throw into the cage. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Aether! Water isn&#39;t wet, &lsquo;cause why not!&rdquo; The theater kid laughed at an unbearably bright pitch, their overflowing happiness seeming to affect Kafka&rsquo;s classmates close to him. Before long, everyone began cheering for the heroes that miraculously saved them, nonsensical like a weekend dream.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The spell reached Kafka in the vine embedded cage, and she quickly snapped out of her dazed stupor, watching the newly planted bomb next to her tick down to a minute. &ldquo;What about me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Whoops, forgot about that! In a bit of a pickle, I see. Let&rsquo;s see you marinate your way out!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">They grinned, not minding a bit of the girl&rsquo;s trembling.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;HOW DO I MARINATE???&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Before Kafka was about to die a third time today, probably for real now, she was suddenly carried away in a sparkling, crackling gust, back on to the sweet earth safely.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Phantom! That comes in, like Lesson 2 of Culinary skills for disembodied dreamers!&rdquo; Near Kafka was a bright-eyed girl who glittered as much the wind that flew her back. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oh hey, guys. Rio here. Hm, coffee or tea? Tea, most of the time, but it really depends on my mood.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As much as Kafka was thankful for the miraculous rescue, her consciousness seemed to begin fading. Every random thought and emotion seemed to be squeezed out by the sound of a quiet hum that murmured of faraway galaxies and spinning stars steadily running out of hydrogen. A single idea occupied her mind: the universe was indifferent, and her existence was just a singular blip of the infinite road of spacetime.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Why breathe? It merely resulted in bits of carbon dioxide that would compose the slightest fraction of great landmasses, ancient trees, entire worlds and civilizations and </span><span class="c4">history</span><span class="c2">, so wouldn&rsquo;t it be better if the oxygen were used for something more meaningful? Yes, for the Universe (the Protagonist, the name simultaneously echoed in her mind). It only seemed logical to stop breathing. And with this decision, Kafka passed out.</span></p></body></html>
