        writing is cool and all, but i prefer reading more because i am incredibly lazy and uninspired most of the time.
    </p>
    <p>
        i like my life like i like my bathwater, nice and lukewarm.
        also because it means that i get to drink coffee and flip pages late at night, lit by the ghostly glow of my bedside lamp,
        and leave the worries about the effects of caffeine to the morning me.

        sometimes, if i'm lucky, i can even hear rain falling lightly against my window.
    </p>
    <p>here are some books that i thought were pretty neat:</p>
    <ul style="padding: 0">
        <li><strong>lives of a cell by lewis thomas.</strong></li>
        <li>
            <strong>being mortal by atul gawande.</strong>
            apparently the author's other book about cancer was more well-liked, but i like this one better.
            the way that he weaves the history of terminal care is cinematic, awe-inspiring.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>a short history of the universe by bill bryson</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>anthropocene reviewed</strong>
        </li>
    </ul>
