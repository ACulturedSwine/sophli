    <h1>about 🐾</h1>
    <p>A game idea that I had in mind a couple of years ago, featuring lovely dogs and silly little stories. All made from pure HTML. (Okay, fine, also PHP, but minor technicality shush)</p>
    <p>At the time, I programmed a few components and created some plans for how it would work... And then I, uh, forgot about it.</p>
    <p>But! That's okay! I made it now, and because I didn't work on it for so long, I obtained more experience programming and I could have a fresh new perspective on the project.</p>
    <p>Maybe procrastination ain't so bad after all 👍</p>
    <p>Okay, no, it's pretty bad, but it all worked out in the end!</p>
    <p>Enjoy DogHouse, and check out my other projects <a href="https://sophli.in" target="_blank">here</a> pls I'm desperate for attention</p>
    <p>P.S. My favorite dog is a shiba inu. Generic, I know, but I just love it so much.</p>
