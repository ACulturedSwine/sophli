            <p class="typewriter">welcome to the zoo</p>
            <p>lifeiszoo is a personal project that i created to write about the various things in life that intrigue me.</p>
            <p>
                at first, i thought about creating a digital animal encyclopedia/dex of sorts covering various creatures.
                kind of like those animal videos that pop in your youtube recommendations from time to time, but in the form of a website.
            </p>
            <p>i realized, though, that there is so much more that i could write about.</p>
            <p>life is a zoo, after all, and i hope you'll enjoy it as much as i do.</p>
