                        mangrove species don't descend from one ancestor, but are a result of convergent evolution!
                        this is when life under certain conditions is like 'hey these abilities are pretty neat'
                        and adapts them. repeat this multiple times throughout the course of evolution and you got
                        a bunch of similar looking things that aren't genetically related.

                also the name sounds nice and is easy to remember: saccharine? saccharum.
                not be confused with silver maple (acer saccharinum), its gentlemanly and refined cousin.
